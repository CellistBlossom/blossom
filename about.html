  <h1>Hi, I'm Blossom!</h1>
  <p>This is my personal site! I'm an amateur web developer and I'm learning as I go.</p>
  <p>My pronouns are they/them and I'm currently really into Hollow Knight! Mostly I'm a glitched runner and a randomizer racer. I have a <a href="https://www.smallhomothetyorganization.org/">seperate site</a> all about these things, go check it out!
    I'm very passionate and I love what I do. I even won a tournament at least once! ^-^</p>
  <p>I also really love music. I've been playing piano since age 4 and cello since age 9. Classical and instrumental music has been a part of my life for so long I can't even remember a time where it wasn't a core feature of my personality.</p>
  <p>I say "yippee" a lot, and I love cats and caterpillars and cute things. One day I want to get a cat but that's a plan for the future. My favorite caterpillars are <a href="https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/bfly/bfly2/eastern_black_swallowtail.htm">eastern black swallowtails</a>.</p>
  <p> Also was really into Undertale for a very long time (2015 to the present, although the height of my hyperfixation was probably 2016-2020). Ever since I first started forming memories I've jumped from obession to obsession. I don't usually have a very wide range of interests at any point in time, I just pick a few things and stick with them for a few years. It's an autism thing i guess.</p>
  <p>I feel like I've done  a little  bit of everything in terms of my online life. I wrote fanfiction for a while (if you had the unfortunate luck of knowing me when I was in middle school, yes, I'm the same "Blossom the Cellist"), RP, lore analysis, both original music and arrangements/fan remixes, and now I've moved onto speedrunning, streaming and some techie stuff. When I get passionate about something I get really deep into it. I wonder where my life will lead me next?</p>
