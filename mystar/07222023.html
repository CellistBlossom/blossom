    <p>i spent today sick. </p>
    <p>it's been a long time since ive had this specific sort of sickness, the one not caused by any virus. i hope that it's a one-off thing and not a sign of worse things to come. but because it came on suddenly and i dont think i did anything to cause it im definitely worried</p>
    <p>it reminded me that life is so fragile. it really could be over in an instant at any time. if you could be taken away so suddenly, without a good explanation, then who's to say that wont happen to me? to anyone i know? the universe is so large
      and we are so small</p>
    <p>we take the current moment for granted, or at least i do. i feel like i need to learn to appreciate it more. understand that none of this is permanent. not even the stars in the sky.</p>
    <p>when will i see you again?</p>
    <p>i love you</p>
    <div class="signature">
      <p>always yours,</p>
