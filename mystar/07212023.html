      <p>it's been a while since we last talked. a lot has happened in that time. it's strange how time keeps passing, and as we get older it keeps speeding up. has it really been over a year? im having a hard time believing that. maybe 365 days of "day one", is that really a year? i'm not actually sure if that makes any sense at all.</p>
      <p>i'm rambling, of course im rambling, i had caffeine today. i made a <a href="https://www.chocolatesandchai.com/mocha-mug-cake-recipe/">mocha mug cake</a>, it was pretty good. didn't actually have all the ingredients though but it tasted fine i guess. kinda lied to everyone abt actually eating dinner (i didn't, but at least i hydrated).</p>
      <p>can you believe we're adults? i barely feel like one and im in my last year of college (probably, unless my health gets shit again). kinda wish we had gotten to meet up at some point. i met up with jenjen in may (!!!) and paum a few weeks ago (!!!). my first time meeting any online friends irl and we had a great time!!! we got ice cream and sushi like i always beg people to lol</p>
      <p>one day i want to go visit you but it'll be a lot harder now (obviously). i'll have to ask your sister at some point but im kinda scared to. and obviously plane tickets are expensive, but it's on my bucket list. might have to make it a road trip around europe of sorts so i can justify going all the way over there. guess that's a plan for "when i get rich" or whatever</p>
      <p>i've been dming you on discord, and i hope you got my messages, but they delete inactive accounts after a few years so i know that's gonna be gone eventually. i've worked hard to archive your twitch stuff and hopefully will get to work on the youtube stuff soon. it's important to me and a lot of people that these things stay up despite your absence. we miss you so much. a lot of people in the community wish they got to meet you</p>
      <p>so many things have happened this past year that im having trouble thinking of where to start. i think the most important thing i want to say is that im a verifier now!!! i really wish we got to be verifiers together since i know we would have had a lot of fun together. it was a struggle to find my place in the community again after you passed since you were my rock in a sense i guess. but i think ive found it now. but of course i could never replace you.</p>
      <p>i remember about a year ago, i said "i just want to tell you i love you one more time". now im realizing just one time could never be enough. i love you. i love you. i love you. i love you.</p>
      <p>i love you, schy. i'll find some time to write another message soon.</p>
