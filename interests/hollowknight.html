    <h3>Bio or something </h3>
  <p>I picked up Hollow Knight in July 2020 and got all achievements in September of that year. Then I found the randomizer mod and played through a few seeds on my own. It was fun!</p>
    <p>I got recommended some of the 2020 lockout tourney vods on Youtube and was absolutely obsessed with them. I wanted to play the way those people did. Like, really badly. It took months of a friend encouraging me and telling me I was capable. At the end of November in 2020, I had a dream about getting ready for a rando race, and having a community of friends around me cheering me on, and that was the last push I needed to join my first blackout true ending race. I was teamed with Uninformedpotato! Shoutouts to Popato. November 29th, 2020, back when the rando community was still in HKMain. lmao</p>
    <p>Anyway, the dream came true, I'm a rando racer and have a bunch of cute friends who I love cheering me on. Yippee!</p>
    <p>As for speedrunning, I tried any% NMG in October 2020 and was kinda on the fence about it. The more I tried it, the more I felt it was same-y and pointless. I think I watched Fire's any% guide up until Watcher Knights, went "yeah that's all I need to know, time to do a speedrun!" and then discovered that it felt less fun and more like eating fiberglass. So anyway.</p>
    <p>After joining the rando community, Jamie got me running 4MS for a few days. That also sucked. Then I went "well maybe I just hate latest patch" and tried ACN and low% on 1221 and also hated that. Okay, maybe I just hate speedrunning. Maybe that isn't for me.</p>
    <p>Then all that changed when Staxis and Schy attacked.</p>
    <p>They (where "they" means "Schy taught me and Staxis forced me to do my best") introduced me to the True Ending All Glitches route in mid 2021, back before latest patch room dupes were discovered. I ran it for a while, then routed all grubs all glitches with the two of them! Now there's a Blossom AG corner on pretty much every unofficial meme category on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSHyJ2ZdtTPvoudRJ_VAW_an61MumAHdsQOm4Z9wvn_ou73rxX9w9ydb_lDuyOTCnXvmb68HlMrjPYa/pubhtml#">Quack sheet</a>. Can you believe I thought I hated speedrunning? Floating flying weeee is so fun!!!!!</p>
    <p>Also ILs!!!! I love ILs. Movement ILs are the best ones, and I literally fell in love with Path of Pain right after my casual, so there's that too. I'm a simple grub. I just want rando and path of pain and glitches and yippee</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mainbox">
    <h3>Rando? In my rando?</h3>
    <p>So over the years I've spent hours and hours and hours trying to make rando and glitches more accessible for everyone. I had a rough time trying to figure out how to start racing; you really had to search for literally any information about rules or settings or formats or how any of it worked at all, most of it was hidden in a Discord I didn't know about for ages, and even there a lot of it wasn't pinned and you just had to ctrl f and pray.</p>
    <p>All of that to say that <a href="https://www.smallhomothetyorganization.org/">you should go and give my rando crash course webbed site some love. And also join a rando race. I'll give you a free cookie.</a></p>
    <p>I was working on a Google doc guide for rando for a few months, but I've abandoned it in favor of fleshing out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7dXvvR7Ohco2Hs91_9K-yQ6Gusll6_62">skips playlist</a>, since at the time of making it there weren't really any guides that covered everything (or a least most) of what could be in logic. I've put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7HPl7ST6xzMNPSa0MhGWuDw_mSL9FQR-kwC2sgADbQ/edit#heading=h.hrnxovtc0ac1">searchable Google doc</a> to go along with it! I've also added a bunch of the stuff on it to the <a href="https://hollow-knight-randomizer.fandom.com/f">rando Wiki</a>, though hopefully at some point we can move away from using Fandom for it.</p>
    <p>As for events and stuff, I've been in a bunch! I'll list everything I remember here:</p>
    <div class="list">
